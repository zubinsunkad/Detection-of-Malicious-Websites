# Genuine or Malicious website Classification

In this project, we aim to classify websites based on the URL response and its interaction with
network and application layer attributes on the host machine. We have used one linear - logistic regression and one
non-linear classifier - decision tree to classify the data and compare their performances.

### Prerequisites and Installation
